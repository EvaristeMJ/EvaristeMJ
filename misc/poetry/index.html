                It has been few years since I started writing poetry. I mostly write in French.
                I have published a few poems in the student journal of my school.
                My favorite poet is Jacques Prévert.
                I like to write under constraint, inspired by the Oulipo movement.
                Here is for example a poem I wrote influenced by "Mille milliards de poèmes" by Raymond Queneau:
